# WebMD-Drug-Review-Classification

Final Project for CS1470 (Brown University, Spring 2022)

Necessary Setup:
In addition to the regular CS1470 virtual environment, you will need these packages: <br /> 
pip install pandas <br /> 
pip install lime <br /> 
pip install ipython <br /> 


You also have to unzip “webmd.csv.zip” prior to running. <br /> 
This is because the actual file “webmd.csv” is too large for Github.
