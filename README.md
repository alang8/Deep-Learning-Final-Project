# Deep-Learning-Final-Project
Final Project for CS1470 (Brown University, Spring 2022)

Necessary Setup:
In addition to the regular CS1470 virtual environment, you will need these packages:
pip install pandas
pip install lime
pip install ipython


You also have to unzip “webmd.csv.zip” prior to running. This is because the actual file “webmd.csv” is too large for Github.
